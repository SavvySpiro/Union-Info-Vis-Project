## Running the Code
Visualization is a Dash web app, but currently just on localhost:8050 and not on an actual site.

IF RUNNING FOR THE FIRST TIME: 
1. Run pdf_to_png.py first to generate individual images fromt the background contract PDF
2. Run the app.py file and open http://localhost:8050/ in your web browser
See requirements.txt for required libraries that may need to be installed.
