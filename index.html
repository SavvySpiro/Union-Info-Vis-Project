<h1 style="text-align: center;">See What's at Stake: Northeastern/GENU-UAW Contract Proposal Visualized</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Alenna Spiro, Noah Rae-Grant</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">CS 7250 Fall 2025 Final Project</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional contract negotiations which are article-by-article, Northeastern University released a complete 'Final' contract proposal all at once. Our dashboard visualizes key provisions to help union members and curious graduate students understand what's being offered.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>When we first were planning this project, both of us were coming at it from the angle of being the target audience. We had heard about the union a bit, but we didn't know what state the contract negotiations were in, why it was taking so long, and what graduate student workers would get out of the contract.</p>
<p>After interviewing a few union members, we realized our visualization should do two things: explain the contract, and be a source of information for incoming graduate students. The union has primarily done grassroots outreach through labs, which makes it difficult to reach masters students or students in labs where there is no current presence. Having a webpage that can supplement the grassroots outreach will be helpful in reaching those two audiences.</p>
<p>During our interviews, we also found out that one of the current negotiation stumbling blocks was healthcare, and we were asked to compare Northeastern's health plan to other area universities.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>For this project, we predominantly focused on the contract and its various iterations, but we also incorporated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-reported stipend data from <a href="https://www.phdstipends.com/">phdstipends.com</a>&nbsp;from 2011-2025 for Northeastern and other Boston-area students</li>
<li>2025 health plan information from Boston-area universities</li>
</ul>
<p><em>AI Disclosure:&nbsp;</em>For the task of turning the contract into data, we did use the Claude LLM for two things: finding the differences between each iteration of the contract, and summarizing the final versions of the different articles. This was the only use of LLM tools in our project.</p>
<p>The final contract data encompasses the articles, the topic of what was changed within each article, the date it was changed, the party that made the change, and a short summary of what was changed. Each of these articles was grouped into a larger themed group (such as "Employment (Requirements)" or "Benefits") for display purposes.</p>
<p>The Boston-area universities we are using for comparison are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Boston University (BU), Harvard, University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass), and Tufts University. We chose these universities because they are also unionized, and those unions have or are in the process of negotiating contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the stipend data being self-reported, it can be somewhat erratic and inconsistent. However, we felt that it does successfully show the general trend of how stipends grow but still remain between the living wage for a single person in the area, as calculated by the <a href="https://livingwage.mit.edu/">MIT Living Wage Calculator</a>.</p>
<h2>Task Analysis</h2>
<p>At a high level, our primary task was to offer an explanation of the contract and a tool for graduate students to analyze it themselves. As part of this, we had to figure out how to compare to other local universities and what specific information we wanted to convey.</p>
<p>To do this, we decided on three major topics we wanted to examine: stipends, healthcare, and the contract negotiations themselves. We would consider our project successful if a user was able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare stipend amounts between different Boston-area universities, as well as between departments and colleges within Northeastern</li>
<li>Compare what different Boston-area universities offered in their healthcare plans</li>
<li>Explore what articles changed the most and how during the negotiations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/qOejvHN.jpeg" alt="Post-it note sketches with a central contract framework surrounded by potential subplots" width="500" height="374" /></p>
<p>While our original idea had everything as separate visualizations, the project came together when we decided to use the contract itself as our framework. Clicking on a part of the contract would pop out a chart that provides an explanation of that section or a comparison related to that section.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/Fw7yN48.jpeg" alt="Whiteboard sketch of a timeline, with text bubbles at different points saying &quot;GENU did this&quot; and &quot;NEU did that&quot;" width="500" height="292" /></p>
<p>The timeline ended up very different than our original sketch, due to the complexities of the negotiation. Our original line, with a single point for each time, ended up proving very insufficient for what we wanted to convey.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/MYVD7R0.jpeg" alt="Whiteboard sketch of a line chart showing increasing PhD stipends, with a wiggly dashed line for inflation" width="500" height="292" /></p>
<p>We spent a while trying to get inflation working as part of our stipend visualizations, and we ended up having to scrap that part of our stipend idea. Instead, we added lines to compare the Massachusetts poverty line and the Boston-area living wage to our stipend data.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/a4sqrEg.png" alt="Paper sketch of a unit chart to show healthcare benefits" width="500" height="532" /></p>
<p>The unit chart for health plan benefits stayed reasonably close to its initial design, with largely aesthetic changes to make it clear. The upper portion of the chart shows benefits included in each plan, while the lower portion are items excluded from plans. Each icon represents a different element of a health plan, such as primary care, dental plans, or emergency room costs.</p>
<h2>Final Visualization</h2>
<p>## DEMO HERE</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/wUWRpyc.png" alt="Final landing page design" width="501" height="250" /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/6l3qBQd.png" alt="Navigation tab" width="500" height="345" /></p>
<p>Our final design allows a user to scroll through the current iteration of the contract. A yellow box indicates a clickable portion that will pop out a visualization. We also provide a table of contents at the top for quickly jumping between the different visualizations rather than scrolling.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/rNeFqol.png" alt="Final timeline visualization" width="500" height="356" /></p>
<p>The timeline visualization went through the most iteration, due to the complexity of what was being conveyed. Our usability testing showed that it was the most difficult to navigate and understand. Many users read it as a bar graph at first, or didn't understand why there was a particular subplot. After lots of back and forth between different options, we settled on using a diverging color palette to represent which party made the change (reds for the union, blues for the university) and the number of changes made relative to the maximum changes that article went through.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/RFvGsZq.png" alt="Grouping dropdown select and tooltip" width="500" height="249" /></p>
<p>The articles are grouped by theme. We initially tried to do all 41 articles in one visualization, but it was severely cramped and difficult to read. We found that groups of 4-7 were optimal, so we made the thematic groups and a dropdown to swap between them. Hovering over a bar shows what date the changes were made, how many were made, and how much time there was until the next change. "Present" is represented as May 30, 2025, as (to our knowledge) there have not been any changes to the contract proposal after that date.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wJVQh7q.png" alt="Default proposal exploration view" width="500" height="226" /></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/9CGkxBs.png" alt="Proposal examination view after selecting a bar" width="500" height="226" /></p>
<p>Selecting any bar in the timeline opens up an examination of what changed in that article on that date, as well as a summary the final version of the article. Instead of the final version summary, our original design had a bar chart showing the number of changes over time, as our timeline initially did not have the diverging scale and the color was just determined based on party. Since that became a redundant encoding, we were able to add in the summary of the final article, which some of our test users mentioned they wanted to see.</p>
<h3>Stipends</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/e6lkcOw.png" alt="Line chart depicting the change of Boston-area PhD stipends since 2011" width="500" height="315" /></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/E3JpIcc.png" alt="Line chart depicting changes in Northeastern PhD stipends since 2013" width="500" height="331" /></p>
<p>Both stipend-related charts are line charts, showing the change over time since our earliest data. As noted in the "Data" section above, the stipend data is erratic due to the nature of being self-reported. To mitigate this as much as possible, we averaged the stipend amounts by university or department, filtered out certain departments that only had a single point of data, and grouped together some departments that were within the same college at Northeastern.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/YEvvnzG.png" alt="Hover tooltip detail for the Boston-area university stipend chart" width="500" height="315" /></p>
<p>Hovering over either chart opens up a tooltip displaying what the average pay was for that university or department during that year. The department-level chart can also be filtered by different Northeastern colleges, such as Khoury College of Computer Science or the College of Engineering.</p>
<h3>Health Plan Benefits</h3>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/8A9buBV.png" alt="Unit chart depicting what Boston area university health plans offer" width="500" height="392" /></p>
<p>The health plan unit chart went through a few iterations, finally ending up with the icon overview on the left and the detail bar chart on the right. We initially used a green/red color scheme, but given how we use red as a popout effect elsewhere, we decided to change it to blue/yellow on the advice of Prof. Borkin.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/4DozQfb.png" alt="Detail view of the health plan benefits tooltip" width="500" height="292" /></p>
<p>Hovering over an icon shows what that specific university's plan provides for that benefit, and clicking on it will open up the comparison bar chart showing how much is covered by each plan. For the bar chart, blue indicates a "good" benefit, such as lower cost co-pay or a larger amount covered by insurance.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://i.imgur.com/zv0YqGh.png" alt="Hover detail for health plan benefit legend" width="400" height="321" /></p>
<p>Hovering over each item on the legend also provides an explanation of what that part of the plan covers. The health plans can be filtered by provider as well, in case someone wants to see if their preferred provider is within network.</p>
<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<h3>Stipends</h3>
<p>Given the data we have, we can see that Northeastern's 2025 overall average pay is slightly lower than other private universities in the area (due to its nature as a public university, UMass-Boston has a different pay scheme than other area universities). However, none of the stipends are near the calculated living wage of $63,942 for a single person in the Boston area, meaning almost all PhD students in the area would need to live with at least one other person. Stipends have overall gone up since 2011, and most are at least closer to the living wage than they are to the Massachusetts poverty line ($15,650 annual income).</p>
<p>As for Northeastern-specific departments, the stipend amount varies depending on what college a program is in. For example, departments under the Khoury College of Computer Science tend to have a higher stipend than programs in the College of Social Sciences and Humanities. In 2023, the average computer science stipend was approximately $50,000, while the average political science stipend was $10k less at approximately $40,000.</p>
<p>However, given our data's iconsistencies due to being self-reported date to a single specific site, this trend would require further examination.</p>
<h3>Health Plan Benefits</h3>
<p>While most health plans cover most things people would require, there are three benefits that are commonly excluded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birth control is only explicitly covered by Tufts's and Harvard's plans</li>
<li>Only MIT offers dental coverage as part of the primary plan. Tufts and Harvard offer optional dental plans.</li>
<li>Eyeglasses are only covered by the MIT and Tufts health plans.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it does seem like Northeastern's health insurance is competitive with other area universities, though it lacks in the three areas listed above. Some of the plan pricing does rely on being in Blue Cross Blue Shield's network, which might mean certain specialty care areas aren't easily accessible in-network.</p>
<p>Notably, the Tufts plan details that we were able to find are unclear about how much the plan covers. There are no listed co-pay or deductible amounts.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>When we first conceived of the timeline, we expected that bargaining and employment-related articles would have the most back-and-forth changes. For the most part this was correct, but one of the most surprisingly contentious issues was that of professional development (which we grouped under "Benefits"). This particular article was changed 8 times overall, alternating between the union and the university, before ending in its final form of offering up to $750 reimbursement per year for paid professional development opportunities with supervisor approval. Some of the other most back-and-forth article changes are for employment records, appointments and reappointments (both under "Employment (Requirements)", travel (under "Employment (Rights)", and the labor management committee (under "Union (General)").</p>
<p>Additionally, there are some articles that get introduced but never acknowledged or changed by the other party, particularly for certain benefits that the union proposed like tax assistance, retirement, relocation assistance, and housing support.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Following legal negotiations as a non-expert is a challenge, and we hope that our project helps bridge the gap for the average graduate student at Northeastern and helps them understand what this contract would mean for them.</p>
<p>In future work, we would like to add some more visualizations for other sections, as well as pull in data for comparable non-Boston universities. In particular, we would like to gather information from our target audience on what they would want to see next, and reach out to other graduate student worker unions for copies of their contracts to compare. One of the people we did usability tests on asked about visa benefits for international students, and what different area universities offered in terms of visa support.</p>
<p>We also would want to try and use our benefit unit chart design for other types of benefits offered, like time off (vacation, sick, and leave of absence) or housing/relocation assistance. This particularly was a design we liked and would want to iterate on in future works.</p>
