<h1>See What's at Stake: Northeastern/GENU-UAW Contract Proposal Visualized</h1>
<p>Unlike traditional contract negotiations which are article-by-article, Northeastern released a complete 'Final' contract proposal all at once. This dashboard visualizes key provisions to help union members and curious graduate students understand what's being offered.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>When we first were planning this project, both of us were coming at it from the angle of being the target audience. We had heard about the union a bit, but we didn't know what state the contract negotiations were in, why it was taking so long, and what graduate student workers would get out of the contract.</p>
<p>After interviewing a few union members, we realized our visualization should do two things: explain the contract, and be a source of information for incoming graduate students. The union has primarily done grassroots outreach through labs, which makes it difficult to reach masters students or students in labs where there is no current presence. Having a webpage that can supplement the grassroots outreach will be helpful in reaching those two audiences.</p>
<p>During our interviews, we also found out that one of the current negotiation stumbling blocks was healthcare, and we were asked to compare Northeastern's health plan to other area universities.</p>
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>For this project, we predominantly focused on the contract and its various iterations, but we also incorporated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-reported stipend data from <a href="https://www.phdstipends.com/">phdstipends.com</a>&nbsp;from 2011-2025</li>
<li>2025 health plan information from Boston-area universities</li>
</ul>
<p>For the task of turning the contract into data, we did use the Claude LLM for two things: finding the differences between each iteration of the contract, and summarizing the final versions of the different articles. This was the only use of LLM tools in our project.</p>
<p>The final contract data encompasses the articles, the topic of what was changed within each article, the date it was changed, the party that made the change, and a short summary of what was changed. Each of these articles was grouped into a larger themed group (such as "Employment (Requirements)" or "Benefits") for display purposes.</p>
